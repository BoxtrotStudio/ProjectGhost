Official repo for the game Project Ghost

## What is this?

Project Ghost is a free-to-play open source, online multiplayer arena game. This repo holds the wiki for the game as well as the API code used by the server. The API code is used for every game played on the server and acts as sort of the "rules of the game".

## Why open source?

The people behind Project Ghost strongly believe that open source software is important. We also want the community to participate in the creation of this game. While this is repo is in the very early stages, any and all contributes are encouraged :)

## Where's the code?
